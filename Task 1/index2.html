    <h2>Molecular Formula</h2>
    <p>
      <b
        >It is the formula of a substance which shows the actual number of atoms
        present in the molecule.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Molecular formula gives more clear information about a compound as it
      shows the total number of itoms in the compound.<br />
      Covalent compounds exists as discrete molecules which are represented by
      their <i>molecular formula</i>; it provides us more clear information
      about the compound.<br /><br />For Example:<br />C<sub>6</sub>H<sub
        >6</sub>
      is the molecular formula of benzene.<br />C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
      is the molecular formula of glucose and it consists of 6 formula units.

    <h2>Molecular Mass</h2>
    <p>
      <b>It is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms of all the elements present
        in the molecules.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Molecular Mass is expressed in "amu" relative to atomic mass of C<sup>12</sup><br />For e.g, the molecular 
      mass of one molecule of water is 18 a.m.u.
      which is 18 times heavier than 1/12<sup>th</sup> mass of C<sup>12</sup>
      atom.
